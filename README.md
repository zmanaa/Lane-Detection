# Project description
This is a lane detection algorithm written with python programming language with the aid of OpenCV library.

# The User Guide
## Prerequistes
1. install python on your machine.
2. install each of numpy and openCV library.
3. make sure you have the projects assets.

## Get the Source Code
You can clone the public repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zmanaa/Lane-Detection.git
```
Once you have a copy of the source, you can use it as follows:
### Static Image Module
Run this command in order to get the static image lane detection results
```bash
python3 staticImageLaneDetection.py
```
you can find the result [here](#static-image)

### Video Module
Run this command in order to get the video lane detection results
```bash
python3 videoLaneDetection.py
```
you can find the result [here](#video-output)
